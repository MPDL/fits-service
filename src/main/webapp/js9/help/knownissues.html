<h3><center>JS9 Known Issues</center></h3>

<ol>
<li> <b>All platforms, especially Chrome (June 21, 2014 : NOT resolved)</b>
<p>
Available memory can be a problem when loading very large gzip'ed FITS
files, especially in 32-bit Chrome. JS9 currently reads the entire
FITS file or gzip'ed file and inflates parts as needed. It can process
files up to approx. 200Mb in size before Chrome runs out of heap
space.  Note that Chrome often will load an ungzip'ed FITS file in
cases where the gzip'ed file fails (though there still are upper
limits on the total space available).  We hope that the 64-bit version
of Chrome (in early Canary release as of 7/1/2014) will alleviate
these problems. Otherwise, we will take a more drastic approach to
memory management within JS9 (at the expanse of speed).

<li> <b>All platforms (June 21, 2014 : NOT resolved)</b>
<p>
The zscale algorithm requires allocation of a fixed-size static memory
buffer. We have limited the size of this secondary buffer to be large
enough to handle a 2048 x 2048 x 4-byte image. If your image is larger
than this, zscale will not run. We will revisit the size of the
static buffer as we gain more experience with the size of images being
analyzed. To date, 2048 x 2048 seems to be a reasonable compromise.

<li> <b>All platforms (June 13, 2014 : NOT resolved)</b>
<p>
When resizing a box region in one direction only (i.e., width or
height), the width of the region's border will be different in each
direction.  This is due to the underlying graphics algorithm used to
resize the region, which changes the scale factor in each direction
individually and ties the border width to that scale factor. We will
fix this in a future release.

<li> <b>All platforms using Chrome (March 27, 2014 : resolved)</b>
<p>
One of the simplest ways to use JS9 locally is by means of the file://
URL scheme, e.g., point your browser to file:///home/me/js9/js9basics.html.
<p>
This does not work in Google Chrome because Chrome does not permit a
local HTML file to read other local files. You can read a relatively
emotional argument about this restriction at:
<pre>
    https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37586
</pre>
<p>
The workaround is to start Chrome with the 
--allow-file-access-from-files switch. On Linux:
<pre>
    chrome --allow-file-access-from-files
</pre>
On a Mac:
<pre>
    open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
</pre>

<li> <b>All platforms using Chrome (November 20, 2013: resolved)</b>
<p>
Google Chrome version 31.0.1650.57 (released for Mac on 11/14/2013)
broke the HTML5 setTransform call and with it, catalog and region
display in JS9 beta9 and earlier. This bug has been fixed in the
Chrome canary build as of December 9, 2013, but it's unclear how long
it will take to release a stable version. A work-around has been added
to JS9 beta10 for Chrome v31 and v32. Update: Chrome v33 is fixed.

<li> <b>All platforms (May 20, 2013: resolved)</b>
<p>
If the "load image" command is part of a group of commands passed to
the js9 script, a race condition can occur when subsequent commands
are executed before the image is fully loaded. To avoid this problem,
images should be loaded in a separate js9 command and the load status
checked for completion before proceeding to manipulate the image.  See
the <b>js9load</b> script for details (or just use the script itself
to load images). (Technical details: images are loaded asynchronously,
so that other parts of the Web page are available during the load
process. A synchronous load could freeze the Web page while
loading. To avoid this situation, external processes should use the
"status load" command to check for a completed load before sending
further processing commands).

<li> <b>Mac OS X (May 10, 2013: apparently resolved)</b>
<p>
On a Mac running Firefox 20 (but not Safari or Chrome), deleting a region
using the individual region's context menu sometimes does not erase it. 
Moreover, this problem only seems to happen when the context menu
is brought up using a long-press (double-click seems to work).
<p>
The underlying issue is that a call to the HTML5 ctx.clearRect()
routine does not actually erase the canvas. It only occurs when
hardware acceleration is turned on with the following FireFox preference:
<pre>
  Preferences -> Advanced -> General -> Use hardware acceleration when available
</pre>
We believe this is a bug in how Firefox is handling the canvas using
the Mac graphics accelerator. Hopefully, it will be fixed in a future
release. Work-arounds include: use double-click to bring up the context menu,
use Safari or Chrome.
<p>
The region generally will disappear as soon as some other JS9 action
is performed that changes the display (e.g. change contrast/bias,
select a menu, display new image, etc). We therefore recommend living
with the problem for a while in the hope that Mozilla fixes it soon.
<p>
Update as of 11/21/2013: This problem apparently has been fixed by
Firefox.

<li> <b>Linux (January 15, 2013: resolved)</b>
<p>
When running Firefox on some Linux machines (especially Debian or
Ubuntu), clicking and moving the mouse does not refresh the image with
new contrast/bias parameters until the mouse actually stops.  Instead
of continually redisplaying the image, the image is redrawn once at the end.
<p>
This problem does not affect Chrome on Linux boxes, so one work-around is to
switch browsers ...
<p>
However, a configuration fix for this problem is proposed here:
<p>
http://www.hackermusings.com/2012/05/firefoxs-graphics-performance-on-x11/
<pre>
	It’s been long known that a vocal minority (or perhaps even
	majority) of Firefox users have had issues with rendering
	performance on X11, but nobody has quite pinpointed what the
	issue is.

	Recently Nicolas Silva landed a change in mozilla-central to
	add a preference to allow for disabling the use of the RENDER
	extension when drawing using Cairo on X11. I’d like to call on
	any Firefox/Linux users who have been experiencing speed
	issues to download the latest nightly and go to about:config
	and set “gfx.xrender.enabled” to “false”. If you could also
	let me know what hardware and drivers you’re running that’d
	also be great.
</pre>
<p>
During our debugging efforts, this fix worked on almost all
Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS machines exhibiting the problem. Here are
detailed instructions to implement the work-around:
<ol>
<li> Start Firefox
<li> Go go the url: about:config
<li> Promise you'll be careful
<li> Type <b>gfx</b> in the Search box to find all graphics parameters
<li> Set <b>gfx.xrender.enabled</b> to <b>false</b>
<li> Exit and restart Firefox
</ol>
<p>
Some Linux machines did not respond to this fix. Instead they were
fixed by setting the <b>about:config</b> parameter named
<b>gfx.canvas.azure.enabled</b> to <b>false</b>. The instructions
for doing this are similar to those above:
<ol>
<li> Start Firefox
<li> Go go the url: about:config
<li> Promise you'll be careful
<li> Type <b>gfx</b> in the Search box to find all graphics parameters
<li> Set <b>gfx.canvas.azure.enabled</b> to <b>false</b>
<li> Exit and restart Firefox
</ol>
<p>
It is clear that Firefox's support for the HTML5 canvas element is
evolving as they develop more sophisticated optimization techniques.
Please let us know if you have problems with contrast/bias redisplay.

<p>
<li> <b>Mac OS X (January 15, 2013: resolved)</b>
<p>
When running Firefox version 17 and below, mouse movement does not update
the position/value display until the mouse stops. Similarly, contrast/bias
mouse movement does not refresh the image until the mouse stops. This happens
<b>only</b> when the following Preference is <b>unset</b>:
<pre>
    Advanced -> General -> Use hardware acceleration when available
</pre>
<p>
To fix this problem, either set the Preference or upgrade to Firefox 18.
</ol>
