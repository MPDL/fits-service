<h3>Adding JS9 to Your Web Page</h3>
<p>
The sample js9basics.html file shows how to add JS9 to a Web page by
assigning JS9 CSS classes to "div" elements.  The js9multi.html Web
page goes further by showing how multiple instances of JS9 can be
added to a Web page using unique IDs.

<p>
To start, several a few JavaScript and CSS files must be loaded into
the Web page.  Ordinarily this is done in the page's header, which typically
will look something like this:
<pre>
  <head>
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge;chrome=1" &gt; 
  &lt;link type="image/x-icon" rel="shortcut icon" href="./favicon.ico"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9support.css"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9.css"&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9support.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="fitsy.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9plugins.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
Order is important: you must load js9support.min.js before you load
js9.js. You must load the plugin files after you load js9.js.  You can
simply copy the order of files as specified in JS9 demo files.

<p>
Instances of JS9 are placed on a Web page by assigning JS9 classes
to ordinary "div" elements. The two important JS9 classes are:
<ul>
<li> <b>JS9:</b> this class will display the main JS9 image window
<li> <b>JS9Menubar:</b> this class will display the JS9 menu bar
</ul>

<p>
For specialized applications, you also can use these classes:
<ul>
<li> <b>JS9Console:</b> this class will display a console window for executing
typed commands (very retro, but often quite useful!)
<li> <b>JS9Info:</b> this class will display a text window for position, value,
and region information (useful if the info is hard to see over the image).
<li> <b>JS9Magnifier:</b> this class will display panner window
<li> <b>JS9Panner:</b> this class will display panner window
</ul>
<p>
Note that all of these secondary windows can be displayed as light
windows using the View menu options (which also allows them to be
moved around on the page). 

<p>
Placement of JS9 div elements should follow standard Web page rules
and constraints.  This means that div elements can be placed in any
order to create different graphical views. For example, the
js9basics.html page places the menubar above the image display, in
keeping with the traditional layout of DS9. The entire JS9 construct
is placed in a data cell of a table, next to a data cell containing
data URLs.

<p>
Multiple instances of JS9 can be added to a single Web page. This is done by
giving each JS9 div element a unique ID. In order to tie otherwise separate
JS9 components together, the IDs should be specified as follows:
<ul>
<li> start with a unique ID name, e.g. "myJS9".
<li> follow with an optional dash or underscore (not needed for the main window)
<li> finish with the type of JS9 element:
"Menubar", "Panner", "Magnifier" "Info", or "Console".
</ul>

<p> An example of defining multiple instances of JS9 is found in
the js9multi.html file. Two DS9 instances are defined, having IDs of
"JS9" (the default) and "myJS9". When "myJS9" is the main ID,
"myJS9-Menubar" specifies the associated menu bar and "myJS9Console"
specifies the associated console.  

<p>
The ID is not required if there is only one JS9 instance on the page,
since it defaults to "JS9". However, if your site needs to communicate
with clients using <b>js9</b>, you can differentiate between clients
loading the same JS9-enabled Web page by supplying a unique ID when
the JS9 page is served.

<p>
The js9.css file contains CSS directives for various parts of
JS9. These can be modified (or overwritten) as needed, subject to
ordinary CSS rules.

<p>
<h3>Adding Server-side Analysis Tasks to Your Web Page</h3>
</a>
<p>
Server-based JS9 analysis tasks can be executed using
the <b>Analysis</b> menu, but they also can be executed directly from
the Web page using HTML elements (buttons, forms, etc.) To do this, a
Web page author simply create the interface and calls
either <b>JS9.RunAnalysis()</b> (for buttons, menus, etc.)
or <b>JS9.SubmitAnalysis()</b> (for forms). These are described
in the <a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> web page.

<p>
<h3>Adding Local Analysis Tasks to Your Web Page</h3>
</a>
<p>
JS9 also supports the ability to perform local analysis, i.e. analysis
tasks defined right on your Web page, not executed by the back-end
server.  This is accomplished by offering access to the image data and
region information via a <b>public JS9 API</b>. See the
<a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> for more information.

<p>
<h3>Adding JS9 Display Windows Dynamically</h3>
<p>
JS9 display windows can be created dynamically using the JS9 Public API call
<b>JS9.LoadWindow()</b>. You can create a light window to hold a new
JS9 display on the same page or you can create an entirely separate
pop-up window. See the
<a href="publicapi.html">JS9 Public API</a> for more information.

<p>
<h3>Adding Data Files to a Web page</h3> 
<p>
Data files are added to a Web page by supplying URLs that call
the <b>JS9.Load()</b> routine. See:
<a href="yourdata.html">Adding Data Files To a Web Page</a> for more
information.
