<title>External Communication with JS9</title>
<center><h3>External Communication with JS9</h3></center>

<p>
The JS9 <b>Analysis menu</b> provides flexible support for running a
macro-expanded external analysis command on the Web server and
displaying results in the browser. But there are other scenarios in which
it might be desirable for an external process to communicate with the
JS9 client:

<ul>
<li> JS9 might be part of a larger Web-based analysis system
(i.e. instead of the analysis being incorporated into the Analysis
menu). An analysis task might want to query JS9 for its regions.
<li> A Web site might offer "live" tutorials in which JS9 is manipulated
automatically from the server.
<li> A Web site might wish to modify a JS9 client user interface based
on the level of expertise of a given user.
<li> A user running JS9 locally might want to interact with her JS9 client from within a local analysis script.
<li> A remote user might want to interact with her JS9 client in a similar way.
</ul>

<p>
If you run the Node.js-based helper (instead of the CGI helper),
external communication is supported by the <b>js9</b> script and its
underlying <b>js9Msg.js</b> code. The script runs the <b>Node.js</b>
program with js9Msg.js as its first argument. (As such, js9Msg.js
needs to be installed where socket.io has been installed. The default
JS9 installation procedure takes care of this. See the
<a href="install.html">INSTALL</a> page for more info.)

<p>
The js9 script will execute a single JS9 command placed on the command line:
<pre>
  sh> js9 cmap heat        # change colormap to heat
  OK
  sh> js9 cmap             # return the current colormap
  heat
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, if no command is specified, js9 will enter a
readline loop, executing commands as they are input:
<pre>
  sh> js9 
  JS9> cmap heat
  OK
  JS9> cmap
  heat
</pre>
In this way, you can send commands to js9's standard input:
<pre>
  sh> cat test.reg
  region circle {"x":588, "y":590, "radius":30, "tags":"source"}
  region circle {"x":588, "y":590, "radius":10, "tags":"exclude"}
  region circle {"x":390, "y":430, "radius":50, "tags":"background"}
  region circle {"x":390, "y":430, "radius":10, "tags":"background,exclude"}
  sh> cat test.reg | js9    # send regions to JS9
</pre>
(Currently, redirecting to stdin does not appear to display return
messages. We'll fix this in a future release.)

<p> 
A list of JS9 commands can be retrieved using the ''help' command:
<pre>
  sh> js9 help
  analysis     	run/list analysis for current image (ana)
  colormap     	set/get colormap for current image (cmap)
  colormaps    	get list of available colormaps (cmaps)
  help     	get list of available commands
  helper     	get/set helper connection
  image     	get name of currently loaded image or display specified image
  images     	get list of currently loaded images
  load     	load image(s)
  pan     	set/get pan location for current image
  pix2wcs     	get image pixel value for specified wcs position
  print     	print image window
  regions     	add region to current image or list all regions (reg, region)
  scale     	set/get scaling for current image
  scales     	get list of available scales
  url     	display a url
  wcssys     	set/get wcs system for current image
  wcsu     	set/get wcs units used for current image
  wcssystems   	get list of available wcs systems
  wcsunits     	get list of available wcs units
  wcs2pix     	get wcs position for specified image pixel
  zoom     	set/get zoom for current image
</pre>
These are the same commands that are available in the JS9 light-weight 
<b>console</b> window.

<p>
One of the most important JS9 commands is the 'region' (or 'reg' or 'regions')
command, which will create a new region or display the current region(s):
<pre>
  sh> js9 region circle
  OK
  sh> js9 regions
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
Region-specific parameters can be supplied in JSON format after the
shape (see http://www.json.org/). You can pass in any value found in
the Regions.opts object in js9-[version].js:
<pre>
  sh> js9 region circle '{"x":495, "y":495, "radius":25, "color":"yellow"}'
  OK
</pre>
(NB: currently you must specify image coordinates and pixel units. The
syntax will be extended to WCS in a future release.)

<p>
By default, js9 can send a message to a JS9 instance on a client browser if
js9 is run from:
<ul>
<li> the localhost running the Web service and back-end helper
<li> the same host that is running the client browser
</ul>
In the latter case, you will need to use the <b>-helper</b> switch to
specify the back-end helper host to contact. For example, if the Web
server and helper is running on js9.cfa.harvard.edu, you would send a message
to your instance of JS9 this way:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -helper js9.cfa.harvard.edu region circle
</pre>

<p>
If multiple instances of JS9 are connected to the same back-end helper, or
multiple instances of JS9 appear on a single Web page, use the 
<b>-id</b> switch to differentiate between instances. For example, if two
instances of JS9 having div element ids of "JS9" and "myJS9" are
defined on the same page, then js9 can communicate with the latter
in this way:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -id myJS9 region circle
  OK
  sh> js9 -id myJS9 region 
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
or, from the readline loop:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -id myJS9
  JS9> region circle
  OK
  JS9> region -id myJS9
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
Consider a Web site that wants to communicate with multiple
clients. Since it is on the same host as the helper, it is allowed to send
messages to any client.  In order to differentiate between clients
that might be loading the same Web page, the Web server can
generate unique ids for each JS9 div element served to browsers.
Alternatively, if the client host ip addresses are known,
the <b>-host</b> switch can be used to differentiate hosts running the
same page. For example, if you want to control the JS9 client on bynars:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -host bynars.cfa.harvard.edu -id myJS9 region circle
  OK
  sh> js9 -host bynars.cfa.harvard.edu -id JS9 region 
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
or, from the readline loop:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -host bynars.cfa.harvard.edu -id myJS9
  JS9> region circle
  OK
  JS9> region 
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
The js9 interface will evolve to meet the needs of the astronomical
community.
